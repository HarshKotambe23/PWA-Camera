## PWA CAMERA

The progressive web app camera feature provides users with the ability to open and close the camera, take images, and switch camera modes. Opening the camera launches the camera app with options to take a picture or video. Closing the camera exits the app. Taking images captures a still image or video depending on the camera mode. Switching camera modes allows users to switch between the front and back cameras, as well as change between taking still images and videos. With these features, users can capture their favorite moments with ease and convenience.
